# Filecontainer 2.0

Note: This is the new repository for the File Container Project (FCP).

Changes:

-1:Support for an infinite amount of files in one file: Previously, the limit was 25,000 files, and before that, it was only 1,000.


-2:GUI Application: It is now a GUI application and will create an executable GUI Windows app instead of the FC file.


-3:Encryption and Decryption: An encryption and decryption system with password functionality has been added using the Fernet 


library.


-4:Usable Application: It has become a truly usable application. We would start replacing our .zip or .7z files with FCPDA files to 


support it and how secure it's.


5-Note: Currently, you cannot create storage files without a password. While it offers strong encryption, it also requires 


significant storage space and RAM/disk usage. Therefore, it's best suited for smaller files like documents, source code, etc., that 


require secure encryption.


6-Bug Fixes: A significant number of bugs have been fixed in this update. We apologize for any inconvenience caused by previous 


versions.


7-Error Handling: If you enter incorrect information, you will receive a message box with like whole error handling system.


Parameter and Function Changes: Some parameters and functions have been added, removed, or modified.


Readme and License: This readme.md file and the license have been updated (only the owner name has been changed from FPLUgroup*1 to 


WEDU).


Note:FPLUgroup was our first name, followed by Aetheriotech. The current name is WEDU.


Note: If there are any other changes, you can view the difference between this version and the previous commit. However, this 


summary should cover most of the updates.
